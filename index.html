          <p>  Fit4U was a final project completed in a previous class. There are many things covered in both this class and that one that are similar. I'm finding my skills are improving.</p>

          <p>Vicious cycles was designed in a previous class as a larger project.</p>

          <p>This is the first project that the class was assigned to do in WEB120. We were tasked with looking at a pre-designed site and trying to re-create it as close as possible.<p>

          <p>The resume project is a cumulative effort from WEB210. It added on new features week by week.</p>

          <p>The final two pictures are examples of image optimization. (My favorite thing to have learned so far in this course!)</p>

          <p>These were edited from very large files into broadband and load time friendly files without much sacrifice in appearance.</p>
